        "    * **Problema:** Requer uma quantidade massiva de VRAM (mem√≥ria de GPU), sendo invi√°vel para modelos de 8B em hardware comum ou no Colab. Um modelo de 8B com precis√£o total (32-bit) precisaria de `8B * 4 bytes = 32 GB` de VRAM s√≥ para ser carregado, sem contar a mem√≥ria extra para o treinamento.\n",

Em vez de modificar uma matriz de peso gigante `W`, adicionamos o resultado de duas matrizes pequenas, `A` e `B`, que s√£o trein√°veis (`W' = W + B*A`).\n",
